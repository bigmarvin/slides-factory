## Build presentations that matter

# The Problem

- Slides filled with **walls of text**
- Audiences **tune out** after 30 seconds
- Key metrics **buried** in paragraphs

---

# The Solution

- **One idea** per slide
- **Keywords** over sentences
- **Metrics** that pop: `47%`, `10x`, `$2.4M`

---

# Results

- Audience retention: **+85%**
- Presentation prep time: `3x` faster
- Message clarity: **Dramatically improved**

---

# How It Works

- Write **plain text** outline
- Auto-generate **HTML slides**
- Export to **4K video**

---

# Syntax

- `**keyword**` for emphasis
- Backticks for `metrics`
- Keep bullets under **6 words**

---

# Get Started

```bash
./slides.sh new my-talk
./slides.sh all my-talk
./slides.sh preview my-talk
```
